# RAG Q&A Bot

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Q&A bot built in a Jupyter Notebook. It allows users to upload a custom document, which is then processed and stored in a Pinecone vector database using OpenAI embeddings. Users can ask questions about the document's content and receive accurate, context-aware answers generated by an OpenAI language model.

## Features

*   **Dynamic Document Upload:** Users can upload their own text-based documents (.txt, .md, etc.) to be used as the knowledge base.
*   **Vector-Based Retrieval:** Utilizes Pinecone's vector database for efficient similarity search and retrieval of relevant document passages.
*   **AI-Powered Answers:** Leverages OpenAI's language models to generate human-like answers based on the retrieved context.
*   **Interactive Q&A:** Provides a simple input prompt for users to ask questions and receive answers directly within the notebook.

## How It Works

The application follows a RAG architecture:

1.  **Upload:** The user uploads a document.
2.  **Load & Chunk:** The document is loaded and split into smaller, manageable chunks of text.
3.  **Embed & Store:** Each text chunk is converted into a numerical vector representation (embedding) using OpenAI's models. These embeddings are then stored in a Pinecone vector index.
4.  **Query:** When a user asks a question, their query is also converted into an embedding.
5.  **Retrieve:** Pinecone searches the index for the text chunks with embeddings most similar to the user's query embedding.
6.  **Generate:** The retrieved text chunks and the original user query are passed to an OpenAI language model, which generates a final, coherent answer.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x
*   Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
*   An OpenAI API key
*   A Pinecone API key

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TashonBraganca/RAG-Q-A-.git
    cd RAG-Q-A-
    ```

2.  **Open the notebook:**
    Open the `RAG_Q_A_Bot.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

### Configuration and Usage

1.  **Run the first cell** to install the required Python libraries.
2.  **Run the API key cell.** You will be prompted to enter your OpenAI and Pinecone API keys securely.
3.  **Run the file upload cell.** You will be prompted to upload your own document.
4.  **Run the remaining cells** in order to process your document, set up the Pinecone index, and initialize the Q&A chain.
5.  **Ask a question!** In the final cell, enter your question into the input box and run the cell to receive an answer.

## Technologies Used

*   **LangChain:** The primary framework for building the RAG pipeline.
*   **OpenAI:** Used for generating text embeddings and for the final answer generation.
*   **Pinecone:** The vector database used for storing and retrieving document embeddings.
*   **Jupyter Notebook:** The environment for running the interactive Q&A bot.
